## Description
Our project builds upon the World of Code website by implementing a tool called Vulnerability Search. The point of this project is to give Dr. Reid's shell script implementation a user interface on the World of Code website. This makes the tool much more accessible, easier to use, and displays the results in a presentable fashion. This tool takes ideas from the Lookup Search, which was already implemented on the World of Code site, to create a smooth user experience.
## How to get started
To get started with using this search, you may want to first refer to the [World of Code tutorial](https://github.com/woc-hack/tutorial) in order to get a grasp on how World of Code works

Once you have read through the World of Code tutorial to understand how it works, you are prepared to perform a Vulnerability Search

Since this tool is not fully implemented into World of Code, to see the Vulnerability Search tool on the website, please follow the instructions to set up this repository here: https://github.com/loconous/DRE#readme. To get added to the docker container, you may need to contact Dr. Mockus to be added to the World of Code repository.

Once you have the reposirory set up, you can run the command 
```shell
npm run start:dev
```

If the tool is fully implemented on the World of Code site, it can be accessed at www.worldofcode.org/Vulnerability

If you are accessing the site on your local machine, it can be accessed at localhost:3000/Vulnerability
## Using the tool
The Vulnerability Search tool provides a UI for Dr. Reid's shell implentation of the Vulnerability Search

Once you have navigated to the Vulnerability Search page, you will see a form in which you can search for a Vulnerability with a SHA-1 hash 

You may either enter a SHA-1 hash that has a Vulnerability that you would like to search for, or you may select one that has been previously searched from the dropdown menu that appears when you click on the search bar

Once you have selected or entered a SHA-1 hash into the search bar and completed a search, you will be brought to a results page with the search results for the Vulnerability that you searched for

Here, you will be given an interface that has quick statistics from the search such as the total number of commits, authors, and projects with the same Vulnerability were found in the search

There will also be an accordion dropdown list of blobs that contain the Vulnerability. These can be exapanded to show a URL to the actual GitHub project, as well as the commit itself
