<h1>World of Code (WoC)</h1>
is Complete, Curated, Cross-referenced, and Current Collection of Open Source Version Control Data.

It is big: with over 3 billion git commits, 12 billion unique blobs (versions of the source code), 160M repositories, and 60M authors. 

Compressed data takes up 250TB of disk space reduced from over 4PB in original git repositories.

It is research ready with versions of the data, cleaned author IDs, identified related or forked projects, time corrections, API extraction and fully cross-referenced.

WoC makes it possible (and fast) to get 

a) stratified samples from the entirety of OSS, 

b) measure cross-project code flow and developer/code networks, 

c) conduct code or developer census. 

In short it makes research on global properties of OSS not only possible, but fun.
